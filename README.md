==========

A Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) server library for 3rd party server usage.

> *Google Cloud Messaging for Android (GCM) is a service that helps developers send data from servers to their Android
> applications on Android devices. The service provides a simple, lightweight mechanism that servers can use to tell
> mobile applications to contact the server directly, to fetch updated application or user data. The GCM service handles
> all aspects of queueing of messages and delivery to the target Android application running on the target device.*
